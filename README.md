# Powershell Collection
This collection contains various bits of Powershell code and scripts which I've written for various purposes. Some are functional, some instructional, and some probably pretty esoteric.

Powershell is an extremely versatile and useful tool, and the aim is that publishing some of this code will allow more poeple to continue their Powershell journey
